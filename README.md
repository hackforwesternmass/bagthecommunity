# South Hadley's *Bag the Community*

## A community event to support the [South Hadley Food Pantry](http://www.shfoodpantry.org/)

### Challenge

Streamlining volunteer sign-up for a two-day event that involves hundreds of volunteers.  Matching volunteers to blocks of hours or to the several diverse roles that need filling.  
Also, a display of dates and times of the event and other pertinent information in order to  provide town residents with easy access to information and to encourage participation.

### Benefit

Streamlining the registration process will benefit the hundreds of volunteers involved in our project and will provide easy access to the information that every South Hadley resident is intended to receive immediately prior to and throughout our event (massive town-wide food drive).  This will benefit every member of this community of 18,000.

### Audience

Volunteers of the project (approximately 300) and every town resident (information).  
Technical constraints are mitigated through public computer access at our libraries and at our schools.
